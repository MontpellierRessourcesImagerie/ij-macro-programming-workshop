# Exercise 06.01 - Arrays - Creation and accessing elements

Aim: 
- understand what arrays are

Create an array containing the first five prime numbers.
Replace the second and fourth element of the array by its square. 
Display the result.

- An array is created by the ``newArray`` command. You can either list the elements or give a size.
- The ith-element of an array is accessed by the index-operator ``[i]``. 
- The first element has the index 0. 
- ``Array.show`` can be used to display an array in a window.

Your code starts after this line 
```java






```
Your code ends before this line

The code below is for automatically checking the result. Please ignore it! 
```java
Array.getStatistics(a, min, max, mean, stdDev);
ok = min==2 && max==49 && mean==15.2 && (stdDev-19.2146)<0.000001;
if (ok) 
	showMessage("That's right. Great, you did it!");
else 
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
```
