# Exercise 01.01 - Hello World version 1    

Aims:  
- write a minimal working program 
- learn how to write and run macros
- learn how to call build-in functions with parameters

**Type in the command that prints "Hello World!" and 
press the run button or press ctrl+r.** 

The command you need to use, has the name *print* and is used in the 
following way: 
>				print("<your text>"); 
You need to replace `<your text>` with the text you want to print
to the Imagej log-window. 

Your code starts after this line. 
```java


```
<pre>
> Hello World!
</pre>
 Your code ends before this line.

If you want you can use a print command with the 
parameter ``\\Clear`` to clear the content of the log-
window, before writing your message.
