# Exercise 05.02 - Variables and assignment

Aim: 
- Understand that variables containing numbers or strings are copied *by value* in an assignment.

Create a variable ``a`` and assign a value to it. Create a second variable ``b`` and assign ``a`` to it. 
Modify the value of ``b``. What is the value of ``a`` now?

The macro prints the values of ``a`` and ``b``. Did the value of ``a`` change when ``b`` was modified?

Your code starts after this line 
```java



```
Your code ends before this line 
```java

print("a: ", a, "b:", b);

```

The code below is for automatically checking the result. Please ignore it! 
```java

ok = (a!=b);

if (ok) 
	showMessage("That's right. Great, you did it!");
else 
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
```
