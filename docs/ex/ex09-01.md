# Exercise 09.01 - while-loop

Aim: 
- understand the while-loop

The while loop below will use Newton's method to approximate the 
square-root of the number ``input``. 

Write the condition for the while-loop. The calculation should stop
when the absolute  difference between the square of ``guess`` and the
number ``input`` is smaller than one-thousandth.

```java
"\\Clear";
input = 121;
guess = 1;
nr_iterations = 0;
```
Your code starts after this line 
```java





```
Your code ends before this line 
```java
print(guess);

```
The code below is for automatically checking the result. Please ignore it! 
```java
ok = (d2s(guess, 9) == "11.000000002");
if (ok)
	showMessage("That's right. Great, you did it!");
else 
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
```
