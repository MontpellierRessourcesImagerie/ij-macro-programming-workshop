# Exercise 06.02 - Arrays - Copy by reference

Aim: 
- understand that arrays are copied by reference

In the code below an error occured. The second element of the array ``labels`` is "TOO" but it should be "two'".

Assign ``labels`` to a different variable ``correctLabels`` and modify the second element of ``correctLabels``. 

Run the macro to print ``labels`` and ``correctLabels``. What is the result you expect?

```java

labels = newArray("one", "TOO", "three", "four");

```
Your code starts after this line 
```java



```
Your code ends before this line 
```java

"\\Clear";
Array.print(labels);
Array.print(correctLabels);

```
<pre>
> one, two, three, four
> one, two, three, four
</pre>
The code below is for automatically checking the result. Please ignore it! 
```java
logContent = split(getInfo("log"));
ok = (logContent[0] == "one,");
ok = (logContent[1] == logContent[5]);
ok = (logContent[5] == "two,");
if (ok) 
	showMessage("That's right. Great, you did it!");
else 
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
```
