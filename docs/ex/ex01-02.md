# Exercise 01.02 - Hello World version 2  

Aims:  
- write a minimal working program
- learn how to write and run macros
- learn how to call build-in functions with parameters

Another possibility is to display a message in a dialog window.
This can be done with the command

Use the showMessage command instead of the print command 
to display the "Hello World!" message and run the macro (ctrl+r).

Your code starts after this line. 
```java

 Your code ends before this line
