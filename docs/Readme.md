# ImageJ Macro Programming for Biological Image Analysis

Learn how to write ImageJ macros for the automation of image analysis tasks. These are the materials used in the workshop. For each topic there is a short presentation followed by a small exercise that has to be solved by the participants.

Save the file [MRI_Macro_Workshop.jar](https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/ij-macro-programming-workshop/releases/download/v1.0/MRI_Macro_Workshop.jar) into the ``plugins`` folder of your FIJI installation and restart FIJI. You will find the exercises in the ``Templates``-menu of the FIJI-macro-editor.

Here is an online version of the exercises:

- [Part 1 - Programming Basics](./part1.md)
- [Part 2 - Basic Application Examples](./part2.md)
- [Part 3 - Advanced Application Examples](./part3.md)

Download and unzip [images.zip](http://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/attachments/download/2372/images.zip) to access the images needed to complete the exercises.
