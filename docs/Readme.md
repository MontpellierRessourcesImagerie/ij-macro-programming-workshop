# ImageJ Macro Programming for Biological Image Analysis

Learn how to write ImageJ macros for the automation of image analysis tasks. These are the materials used in the workshop. For each topic there is a short presentation followed by a small exercise that has to be solved by the participants.

## Part 1 - Programming Basics

In the first part you will learn the basics of programming.
