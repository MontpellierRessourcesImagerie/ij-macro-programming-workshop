# Exercise 10.01 - do-while-loop

Aim: 
- understand the do-while-loop

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 0 and 1.
The program should continue to ask until the user enters a valid number.
Use a do-while loop to implement this.

```java
do {
```
Your code starts after this line 
```java
	n = getNumber("Enter a number between 0 and 1", 0.5);
} while (n<0 || n>1);
```
 Your code ends before this line

The code below is for automatically checking the result. Please ignore it! 
```java
ok = (n>=0 && n<=1);
if (ok)
	showMessage("That's right. Great, you did it!");
else 
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
```
