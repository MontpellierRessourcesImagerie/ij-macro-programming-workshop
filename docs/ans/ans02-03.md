# Exercise 02.03 - Numbers - Floating point numbers

Aims: 
- be aware of pitfalls when working with floating point numbers

1. Calculate the value of 0.3 minus 0.2 minus 0.1. What is the result?

2. Use the comparison operator (==) to compare the result to 0. Note
that you need to put brackets around the whole expression. Does 
the comparison give `true` (1) or `false` (0).

3. Write a comparison that checks if the result is reasonably close
to zero (the difference should be smaller than one millionth).

```java
"\\Clear";
```
Your code starts after this line 
```java
0.3-0.2-0.1;
(0.3-0.2-0.1==0);
(abs((0.3-0.2-0.1)-0)<0.000001);
```
<pre>
> -2.7756E-17
> 0
> 1
</pre>
 Your code ends before this line

The code below is for automatically checking the result. Please ignore it! 
```java
res = split(getInfo("log"));
if (res.length<3) {
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
	return;
}
if (res[0]<0 && !res[1] && res[2]) 
	showMessage("That's right. Great, you did it!");
else 
	showMessage("Your result is wrong! Please check your macro and try again!");
```
