\chapter{Introduction}

In this workshop you will learn how to write and use macros for the automation of image analysis tasks with the public domain software ImageJ\cite{schneider_nih_2012}. 

Ideally you have already used ImageJ before but you know nothing or very little about programming. If this is not the case you might still find parts of the workshop interesting. If necessary you can discover ImageJ in the same time that you learn the macro programming and if you are already a skilled programmer you can still find information of how to work with ImageJ specific objects.
